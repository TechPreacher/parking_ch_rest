# Swiss Parking API Implementation Plan

This document outlines the implementation plan for creating a FastAPI-based REST application that provides information about parking spaces available in cities across Switzerland.

## Overview

The application consists of two main components:

1. **REST API** that allows users to:
   - Get a list of supported Swiss cities
   - Query parking information for a specific city
   - Get detailed information about a specific parking facility

2. **Streamlit Frontend** that provides:
   - User-friendly interface to browse parking data
   - Interactive map with parking locations
   - Visualization of parking trends
   - Responsive design for both desktop and mobile

## Phase 1: Project Setup and Architecture
- [x] Task 1.1: Initialize Poetry project and configure dependencies
- [x] Task 1.2: Set up project structure
- [x] Task 1.3: Configure linting (RUFF) and type checking (mypy)
- [x] Task 1.4: Define core data models and interfaces
- [x] Task 1.5: Implement configuration management

## Phase 2: Data Source Integration Framework
- [x] Task 2.1: Design data source abstraction interface
- [x] Task 2.2: Implement data source registry mechanism
- [x] Task 2.3: Create base parser classes for different data formats (XML/RSS, JSON, CSV)
- [x] Task 2.4: Implement caching mechanism for API responses
- [x] Task 2.5: Set up error handling and logging framework

## Phase 3: City Parking Data Sources Implementation
- [x] Task 3.1: Implement Zurich parking data source (RSS feed)
- [ ] Task 3.2: Implement Bern parking data source
- [ ] Task 3.3: Implement Basel parking data source
- [ ] Task 3.4: Implement Geneva parking data source
- [ ] Task 3.5: Implement Lausanne parking data source
- [ ] Task 3.6: Implement unit tests for each data source

## Phase 4: API Development
- [x] Task 4.1: Implement API endpoints for cities list
- [x] Task 4.2: Implement API endpoints for city parking information
- [x] Task 4.3: Implement API endpoints for specific parking details
- [x] Task 4.4: Add request validation and error handling
- [x] Task 4.5: Implement API documentation with Swagger/OpenAPI
- [ ] Task 4.6: Add pagination support for listing endpoints

## Phase 5: Testing and Validation
- [ ] Task 5.1: Write unit tests for core functionality
- [ ] Task 5.2: Write integration tests for API endpoints
- [ ] Task 5.3: Implement test fixtures and mocked data sources
- [ ] Task 5.4: Set up CI/CD pipeline for automated testing
- [ ] Task 5.5: Perform API load testing

## Phase 6: Streamlit Frontend Development
- [x] Task 6.1: Set up Streamlit project structure
- [x] Task 6.2: Implement city selection interface
- [x] Task 6.3: Implement parking information display
- [x] Task 6.4: Add interactive map visualization
- [x] Task 6.5: Add parking availability trends visualization
- [x] Task 6.6: Create responsive UI for mobile and desktop
- [x] Task 6.7: Implement VS Code debug configurations for Streamlit app

## Phase 7: Documentation and Finalization
- [ ] Task 7.1: Create comprehensive API documentation
- [ ] Task 7.2: Document how to add new data sources
- [ ] Task 7.3: Add example usage scripts
- [ ] Task 7.4: Create Docker container for both API and Streamlit frontend
- [ ] Task 7.5: Document deployment options (local, Docker, cloud)
- [x] Task 7.6: Create VS Code debug configurations for API

## Success Criteria
1. The API successfully retrieves parking data from at least 5 Swiss cities
2. New data sources can be added without modifying existing code
3. All API endpoints return properly formatted JSON responses
4. All unit and integration tests pass
5. Code passes mypy type checking with strict settings
6. Code passes RUFF linting with no warnings
7. API documentation is complete and accessible via Swagger UI
8. API response time is under 500ms for 95% of requests
9. Application handles network errors from data sources gracefully
10. Clear documentation exists for adding new city data sources
11. Streamlit frontend provides intuitive access to all API features
12. Interactive map shows parking locations with availability status
13. Visualization of parking trends is available in the Streamlit app
14. Streamlit app is responsive and works on mobile and desktop devices
