# Streamlit Frontend Implementation

This file contains an initial implementation of the Streamlit frontend for our Swiss Parking API project, as outlined in Phase 6 of our implementation plan.

## Components Implemented

1. **Main UI Structure**
   - City selection sidebar
   - Tabbed interface (Map View, Chart View, List View)
   - Responsive layout with columns for the parking list

2. **Data Visualization**
   - Interactive map with parking locations using Folium
   - Parking availability chart 
   - Parking occupancy statistics
   - Time-series trend visualization (with simulated data)

3. **User Experience**
   - Color-coded markers based on occupancy level
   - Progress bars for visual representation of occupancy
   - Metrics showing changes in availability

## API Integration

The frontend is currently using hardcoded data for demonstration purposes, but includes:

- An `ApiClient` class that will connect to the FastAPI backend
- Data fetching functions with caching to improve performance

## Next Steps

1. **Connect to the API**
   - Update the data fetching functions to use the real API
   - Implement proper error handling for API failures

2. **Additional Features**
   - Add search functionality
   - Implement filtering options
   - Add user preferences/favorites

3. **Mobile Optimization**
   - Further improve responsive design for mobile devices
   - Optimize map interaction for touch screens

4. **Performance**
   - Add proper loading states
   - Optimize data refresh strategy

## Dependencies

- Streamlit (UI framework)
- Folium (Map visualization)
- Plotly (Charts)
- Pandas (Data manipulation)
