### Major files added, updated, removed
- Created project structure with Poetry for dependency management
- Set up configuration management in `config/settings.py`
- Defined core data models in `models/models.py`
- Created HTTP client utility in `utils/http.py`
- Implemented logging utility in `utils/logging.py`
- Defined data source interface in `core/data_source.py`

### Major features added, updated, removed
- Project initialization with Poetry
- Type checking with mypy and linting with RUFF
- Core data models for Parking and City information
- Environment variable configuration via .env files
- HTTP client for consuming external APIs

### Patterns, abstractions, data structures, algorithms, etc.
- Protocol pattern for defining data source interfaces
- Repository pattern for managing data sources
- Pydantic models for data validation and serialization
- Dependency injection for settings and logging

### Governing design principles
- Modular architecture to separate concerns
- Strict type checking for better code quality
- Interface-based approach for data sources to allow easy extension
- Configuration through environment variables for flexibility

## Phase 2: Data Source Integration Framework
- Completed on: May 5, 2025
- Completed by: Sascha Corti

### Major files added, updated, removed
- Created `core/cache.py` for caching mechanism
- Implemented `core/parsers.py` for various data formats
- Implemented `core/errors.py` for error handling
- Enhanced `core/data_source.py` with caching capabilities
- Created `data_sources/zurich.py` for Zurich parking data
- Set up data source registry in `data_sources/__init__.py`
- Implemented API routes in `api/routes.py`

### Major features added, updated, removed
- In-memory caching system with TTL support
- Data source abstraction and registry pattern
- Base parsers for XML/RSS, JSON, and CSV formats
- Error handling framework for data sources
- Zurich parking data source implementation
- API endpoints for cities, parkings, and health check

### Patterns, abstractions, data structures, algorithms, etc.
- Protocol pattern for parser interfaces
- Generic typing for caching system
- Repository pattern for data sources
- Exception hierarchy for error handling
- XML parsing using lxml

### Governing design principles
- Separation of concerns between data sources and API layer
- Caching to reduce load on external data sources
- Proper error handling and propagation
- Clean API design with appropriate HTTP status codes

## Research Notes

### Available Parking Data Sources

#### Zurich
- Data Source: RSS Feed
- URL: https://www.pls-zh.ch/plsFeed/rss
- Format: XML/RSS
- Update Frequency: Real-time
- Information Available: Parking name, available spaces, total spaces, status

#### Bern
- Data Source: TBD (Research required)
- Need to find official parking data API or public dataset

#### Basel
- Data Source: TBD (Research required)
- Need to find official parking data API or public dataset

#### Geneva
- Data Source: TBD (Research required)
- Need to find official parking data API or public dataset

#### Lausanne
- Data Source: TBD (Research required)
- Need to find official parking data API or public dataset

#### Lucerne
- Data Source: TBD (Research required)
- Need to find official parking data API or public dataset

#### St. Gallen
- Data Source: TBD (Research required)
- Need to find official parking data API or public dataset

#### Zug
- Data Source: TBD (Research required)
- Need to find official parking data API or public dataset

#### Chur
- Data Source: TBD (Research required)
- Need to find official parking data API or public dataset

### Data Source Research Notes
- Will need to analyze each data source for:
  - Data format consistency
  - Update frequency
  - Authentication requirements
  - Rate limits
  - License/terms of use

### API Design Considerations
- RESTful API should follow best practices for resource naming
- Consider implementing caching for frequently accessed resources
- Decide on appropriate error handling and status codes
- Plan for versioning strategy
- Consider rate limiting for production deployment

## Phase 6: VS Code Debug Configuration
- Completed on: May 7, 2025
- Completed by: Sascha Corti

### Major files added, updated, removed
- Created `.vscode/launch.json` for debugging configurations
- Created `.vscode/tasks.json` for common development tasks
- Created `.vscode/settings.json` for consistent VS Code settings

### Major features added, updated, removed
- Multiple debug configurations for the FastAPI application
- Debug configurations for running and debugging tests
- VS Code tasks for running the server, tests, linting and type checking

### Patterns, abstractions, data structures, algorithms, etc.
- VS Code task dependencies for chained task execution
- Environment variable configuration for debugging sessions

### Governing design principles
- Developer experience focused configurations
- Integration with Poetry virtual environment
- Comprehensive debugging support for API and tests

## Phase 6: Streamlit Frontend Implementation
- Completed on: May 7, 2025
- Completed by: Sascha Corti

### Major files added, updated, removed
- Created `src/streamlit_app.py` as the main frontend application
- Created `src/parkings_ch_frontend/components/map.py` for map visualization components
