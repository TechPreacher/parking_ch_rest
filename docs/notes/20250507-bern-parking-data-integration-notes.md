# Bern Parking Data Integration - Notes

## Implementation: Bern Parking Data
- Completed on: 2025-05-07 16:30 UTC
- Completed by: Sascha Corti

### Major files added, updated, removed
- Created `/src/parkings_ch_api/data/parkings/bern.json` with static data for Bern parkings
- Created `/src/parkings_ch_api/data_sources/bern.py` with Bern data source implementation
- Updated `/src/parkings_ch_api/data_sources/__init__.py` to register the Bern data source

### Major features added, updated, removed
- Added Bern as a new city with 17 parking facilities
- Implemented real-time data fetching from the official Bern parking XML feed
- Included coordinates, addresses, and total capacities for all Bern parkings
- Created a mapping system between XML parking identifiers and our internal IDs

### Patterns, abstractions, data structures, algorithms, etc.
- Used the same hybrid data approach as Zurich for consistent architecture
- Fetched real-time availability from the official XML feed (https://www.parking-bern.ch/parkdata.xml)
- Used static data for information not provided by the XML feed (coordinates, addresses)
- Implemented a fallback mechanism for parking facilities not in the XML feed

### Governing design principles
- Single source of truth: Static data stored in JSON, dynamic data fetched from the official source
- Separation of concerns: Data source handles data retrieval, API layer handles presentation
- Extensibility: Following the same pattern as other cities makes adding more cities easier
- Resilience: System works even with partial data from the XML feed

### Technical Notes
- The Bern parking data is available via an XML feed at https://www.parking-bern.ch/parkdata.xml
- The XML provides real-time available spaces, total spaces, and status information
- Parking facilities in the XML are identified by codes like "P01", "P02", etc.
- A mapping dictionary translates between XML identifiers and our internal IDs
- All static data (coordinates, addresses) is stored in bern.json
- Combined approach allows for accurate real-time data with complete location information
